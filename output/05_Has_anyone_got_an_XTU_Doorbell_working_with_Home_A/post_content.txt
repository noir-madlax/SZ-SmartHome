Has anyone got an XTU Doorbell working with Home Assistant?

I'm talking about this model: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09B9PVF86?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09B9PVF86?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1)

I'm struggling to integrate it into my Home Assistant setup. Here's what I've tried:
* **Alexa Integration**: I linked the doorbell to Alexa and set up the Home Assistant Alexa integration. It only shows my Echo Dot, not the doorbell.
* **GitHub Project**: I checked out [giuseppecastaldo/ha_cloudedge_pir](https://github.com/giuseppecastaldo/ha_cloudedge_pir), but it’s archived and doesn’t seem to work anymore.
* **ONVIF/RTSP**: neither is supported by this model.

I’d prefer not to crack open the doorbell for any hardware mods; I want to keep it stock.

Has anyone managed to get this thing working with Home Assistant? Any tips or workarounds? Thanks in advance!
