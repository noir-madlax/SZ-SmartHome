==================================================

What are some recommendations for building automation to safely scare away these puppies from my property? I have HA OS, Reolink cameras, and Gemini AI installed.

It seems to be a full family affair somewhere around my house, 2 adult bears, and 3 child bears. The sightings have become more common in the past few weeks

Ps : the trash can is empty. We do not keep our trash on the driveway
