==================================================

Hi I have smart switch, smart bulb and motion sensor in our ensuite bathroom. I want the lamp to switch on red colour between 12am and 6am so I don't wake my wife. Motion sensor works fine but lamp is white. Seems to need a second movement to change colour to red. I have tried scene setting with red lamp setting to activate but lamp is still white when it comes on via smart switch.Any ideas / templates....?Thanks.
