==================================================

I have it up running three switchbot blind tilts, a few govee items (I think) I went step by step on this guide on youtube. Now the thing is, I have removed the switchbot hub, and the blinds still work. So I know the BT proxy is working. I just don’t know why it’s not passive scanning for NEW or “available” BT devices.  I have numerous devices that it should be detecting. 

In fact I have a TTlock integration that runs BT on the “cloud” through a gateway.  I would love to connect those locks directly to the BT proxy I set up. 

I’ve spent HOURS on YouTube, forums, here, and with a few people. I’m not understanding.   

Thanks if you read that far. I do know HA, I have zwave, zigbee, WiFi, hundreds of devices and automations. This BT stuff is confusing me…any one willing to help me out???
