==================================================

Some folks were commenting on my naming convention but I don't understand. I'm still learning HA so I'm hoping for some advise.

I have two open/close sensors on my fridge. One for the left door, and one for the right door. I've named the devices like so:

* sensor open fridge left door
* sensor open fridge right door

The naming convention that makes sense to me is `[type of device] [where it is]`.

Is there a problem with this? 

And then what do I do about the entities? Should I rename them? What should I rename them to? Like the binary sensor for open/close, should I name it `binary_sensor.open_fridge_door` or something like that? Shouldn't the entity name have the device name in it so we know what entity the device is for?

I don't understand the implications of these names and where/how/why they matter. Hoping for any perspective/advise.
