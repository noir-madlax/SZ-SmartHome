==================================================

I'm ready to expand my HA system and seeking advice for HA controllable plug in outlets for the US market.
Energy monitoring would be nice to have, but last state recovery after a power outage is a must.  Either wifi or zigbee, although I don't yet have a zigbee connection to HA, so recommendations for a good zigbee interface.  Does the esp32-c6 qualify as good?  Don't want a USB one as my HA is virtualized on proxmox and the server is in the basement shop, so would prefer wifi or ethernet.  I checked the hadevices.com site but not enough info there, or is there a better site for HA compatible kit?
