==================================================

I recently bought the HA Green. One of the reasons I wanted it was to try to integrate it with MyQ so I could set it up to open/close the garage door when I arrive/leave the house, without having to push a button. It's kind of annoying to know that my car will do it (it has the MyQ app installed), but the MyQ app on my phone won't do it. So here I am trying to figure out how to do it. 

I've just recently realized that Chamberlain has put up a pay-wall which is effectively blocking HA. Is there any other way this could be achieved without buying a different brand of garage door? I've seen some posts mention RATGDO, but not too sure if that would do what I am wanting. 

Any suggestions? Walkthroughs?
